Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list *k* at a time and return its modified list.

*k* is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of *k* then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

**Follow up:**

- Could you solve the problem in `O(1)` extra memory space?
- You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [2,1,4,3,5]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
Output: [3,2,1,4,5]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 1
Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: head = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `sz`.
- `1 <= sz <= 5000`
- `0 <= Node.val <= 1000`
- `1 <= k <= sz`
