Given an array consisting of `n` integers, find the contiguous subarray of given length `k` that has the maximum average value. And you need to output the maximum average value.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,12,-5,-6,50,3], k = 4
Output: 12.75
Explanation: Maximum average is (12-5-6+50)/4 = 51/4 = 12.75
```

 

**Note:**

1. 1 <= `k` <= `n` <= 30,000.
2. Elements of the given array will be in the range [-10,000, 10,000].
